This is my implementation of the popular online game known as Tetris using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. There is a 20 X 10 grid where different colored pieces known as "tetrominoes" are constantly moving downwards towards the bottom of the grid. A tetromino is moving downard until it hits another settled tetromino or the bottom of the grid, upon which a new tetromino is added to the top of the grid. Whenever a grid row is completely colored/full, that row is removed, and all the colored rows above the removed row are shifted down accordingly. The objective of the game is to remove as many rows as possible. The game ends once a new tetromino cannot be added to the grid due to the area where the new tetromino is supposed to be added is already populated. Users can pause or restart the game anytime they want.
